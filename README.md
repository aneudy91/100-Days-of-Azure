# Target-2 (To Clear Technologies for Microsoft Azure Architects (AZ-303) Certification Exam) 

## Day-35:- 

### Description:- 
* This learning path is designed to help you prepare for the AZ-303 Microsoft Azure Architect Technologies exam. 

* The AZ-303 and AZ-304 exams replace the older AZ-300 and AZ-301 exams, which will retire on September 30, 2020. These two exams are part of Microsoft’s role-based certification program. Candidates who pass both exams will earn the Microsoft Certified: Azure Solutions Architect Expert certification.

* The AZ-303 exam tests your knowledge of four subject areas and that’s how we’ve structured this learning path as well. We’ll start with implementing and monitoring Azure infrastructure. This is the biggest section, and it covers a wide variety of topics, including storage, virtual machines, networking, Azure Active Directory, and more. Next, we’ll show you how to implement management and security solutions. After that, you’ll learn how to create and deploy apps using either Azure App Service or one of the container services, such as Azure Kubernetes Service. Finally, we’ll cover how to implement and manage data platforms.

### Learning Objectives
* Implement and monitor an Azure infrastructure
* Implement management and security solutions
* Implement solutions for apps
* Implement and manage data platforms

### Intended Audience
* People who want to become Azure cloud architects
